# FundRebalance

- I create a Golang generator to generate from abi to Golang code.
- I want to test the bridge from Ethereum to Mantle first. I tried to use the `L1StandardBridge` contract to bridge funds from Ethereum to Mantle. But it seems that the `L1StandardBridge` contract is not working as expected. Mainly because the L1 and L2 tokens are set to wrong addresses.
